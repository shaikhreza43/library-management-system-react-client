          A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily
          accessible for use and not just for display purposes. It is
          responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the
          user's needs on a daily basis. A library provides physical (hard
          copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may
          be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's
          collection can include printed materials and other physical resources
          in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to
          information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

          A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and
          maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such
          as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In
          addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services
          of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting,
          circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information
          needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with
          a variety of resources.

          Library buildings often provide quiet and conducive areas for
          studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration,
          and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic
          resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. The
          library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending
          on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those
          of a special library, for example. Libraries may also be community
          hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong
          learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical
          walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic
          means, including from home via the Internet. Hence managing
          information in an information world has become very easy simply
          because information can be provided or being accessed virtually by
          people who are in remote areas and other places away from the library.

          Libraries may provide physical or digital access to material, and may
          be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's
          collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts,
          films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes,
          DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, table games,
          video games and other formats. Libraries range widely in size, up to
          millions of items.

          Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often
          offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration.
          Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their
          electronic resources and the Internet. Public and institutional
          collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose
          not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection
          themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected
          to have, or who require professional assistance with their research.
